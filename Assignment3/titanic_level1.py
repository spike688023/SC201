----------------------------------
This file builds a machine learning algorithm from scratch 
by Python. We'll be using 'with open' to read in dataset,
store data into a Python dict, and finally train the model and 
test it on kaggle website. This model is the most flexible among all
levels. You should do hyper-parameter tuning to find the best model.
